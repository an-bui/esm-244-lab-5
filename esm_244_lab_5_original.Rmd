```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libraries and data, message = FALSE}
#### libraries ####
library(tidyverse)
library(tseries)
library(forecast)

#### data ####
# US residential energy consumption values (Jan 1973 - Oct 2017, trillion BTU)
energy <- read_csv("energy.csv")
```

First, create 'ts' time series data using information in the res_total column.
```{r time series, message = FALSE}
#### set data as time series ####
res_ts <- ts(energy$res_total,
             # monthly data
             frequency = 12,
             # start January 1973
             start = c(1973, 1))
res_ts

#### plot data against time ####
plot(res_ts)
# looks like there's an increasing trend
# looks additive: highest highs and lowest lows within season remain relatively constant
```

Now decompose the data.
```{r decompose, message = FALSE}
#### decompose function ####
res_dc <- decompose(res_ts)

#### plot ####
plot(res_dc)
# increasing trend
# seasonality (on scale of 100s, so seasonality is big contributor to patterns observed)
# no pattern to residuals
```

There are other ways to visualize the data.
```{r}
#### plot months ####
monthplot(res_ts)
# breaks down within month how values are changing
# mean value for each month over the years

#### season plot ####
ggseasonplot(res_ts)
# lower orange values are in the 1970s, purple pink values are recent
# every year has its own series, tells the same story in a different way
```
